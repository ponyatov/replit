### Language Ideas Promo

* take Lisp homoiconic nature and port it to CPython3 stack (VM & libs)
* provide a light environment for metaprogramming and code generation
* protect people from the parens soup by using infix syntax
  and AST-friendly data structure in place of classic lists
* integrate best features from Python, Lisp/Clojure, and Smalltalk
